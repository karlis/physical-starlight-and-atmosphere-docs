atmosphere - from ground to the space and beyond. Calculations are based on physical properties of how light is
interacting with gaseous medium.

Why procedural skies?
Industry is still using good old HDRI light probe method to do outdoor lighting, and for a good reason - it is the
simplest way to simulate realistic lighting conditions, without worrying that it will look wrong. After all it is a 360Â°
snapshot of a real environment.

HDRI probes unfortunately are not able to capture one crucial aspect - the fact that sky is dynamic. Sky is not just a
membrane of the imaginary rim of the sky, it has volume. Sky is atmosphere and atmosphere is a physical medium
consisting of a blend of gases. Sky literally starts just outside of your eyeball and extends to the outer space.
Sunlight travels through this medium illuminating, scattering and absorbing in it.
