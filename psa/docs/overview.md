Addon interface is divided into 6 sections:

* Sun
* Binary Sun (:octicons-beaker-24: Experimental)
* Atmosphere
* Stars
* Ground
* Artistic Controls

You can hide each of them if you feel the view is getting cluttered. Also notice the `Reset` button after each section,
it will reset the values to defaults.
   
Take a deep breath and have a look at the user interface. It has fancy
names like Kelvins, radiance, and absorption, but I use those to somehow standartize the variables. Other softwares
and scientific tools use similar naming. Also, few of these will be soon replaced with more artist-friendly variables.
